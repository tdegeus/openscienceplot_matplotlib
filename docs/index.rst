openscienceplot_matplotlib
**************************

The goal of this library is to allow you to share the raw-data from a (scientific) plot
in an open way.
In particular:

*   You choose the data that matters to you, and you choose how you organise the
    data-file that you share.
*   Only open (and free!) data file-types are used.
*   Where possible, the amount of code you need to create the data-file is minimal.

.. note::

    A long-term gaol is to have similar libraries for different languages
    (e.g. Python/matplotlib, Matlab, ...)
    and different file-type
    (e.g. HDF5, yaml, JSON, ...)
    to allow sharing data is a custom but still somewhat unified way.
